                <p>The company was found in 1998, spurredby what velos called his "initiating framework", which
                    described his efforts as an initiate to participate in the internet business boom during that time.
                    In 1998, Vivek left his employment as president of Ofcol & Co. and
                    moved to Delhi. He began to work on a buisiness plan for wht would
                    eventually become E-store.</p>
